# LP-Recognition
The project is based on CNN algorithm, including license plates detection, character segmentation, and character recognition.

Detection program is based on Yolo, which is a mature open source Object-detection system. If you are interested, please visit:https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

Character segmentation and recognition programs are both based on training.

Testdata.rar includes 100 images that I used to test the project. The result folder shows all detected license plates from the 100 images.

If you meet any error with the programs, check the file path and your pack versions first. 

To make the project work, you need the training model of license plates detection program. 
Unfortunately, the model is too big to be uploaded to github, I will try to attach it later in the future
